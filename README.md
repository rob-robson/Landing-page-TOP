# Landing-page-TOP
Landing page project from The Odin Project

The object of this project is to build a website using HTML and CSS, to match a layout given in a picture. While the content isn't important and it doesn't need to be pixel perfect, it demonstrates the ability to lay out a website and style it using varous features including basic HTML and CSS, flexbox and external fonts, as well as using Git and GitHub.

Having finished the project I believe I have demonstrated my ability to both use Git/GitHub and basic HTML and CSS to lay out a website, albeit in probably a rather convoluted way at this stage!
